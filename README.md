<h1># viewport-unit</h1>
<p>This is just me trying out the CSS' viewport units.</p> 
<p>Having some fun with them to have a better understanding of how they work.</p>
<p>I have a somewhat not so good memory, so it's not unusal for me to forget something (especially if I don't use it often).</p>
The initial plan for this is for me to keep a base document on how to make a webpage that completely use the browser height, specially when it doesn't have enough content fill it.</p>
<p>I'm going to star with something really simple just to see how it works, and later I might make a real piece of a fake page =]</p>
