# viewport-unit
This is just me trying out the CSS' viewport units. 
Having some fun with them to have a better understanding of how they work.
I have a somewhat not so good memory, so it's not unusal for me to forget something (especially if I don't use it often).
The initial plan for this is for me to keep a base document on how to make a webpage that completely use the browser height, specially when it doesn't have enough content fill it.
I'm going to star with something really simple just to see how it works, and later I might make a real piece of a fake page =]
